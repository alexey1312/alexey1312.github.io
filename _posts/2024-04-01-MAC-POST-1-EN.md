## Karabiner-Elements

[Link](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)

Karabiner-Elements is a tool without which I cannot imagine my work. It's a powerful tool that lets you redefine the actions of any keys, though I mainly use it to redefine the __CapsLock__ key.

In macOS, you can't use the __Tab__, __Delete__,
__F1-F12__ keys, or the standard __CapsLock__ key in shortcuts. However, with Karabiner-Elements, you can assign simultaneous pressing of __Shift + Ctrl + Option + Cmd__ to the __CapsLock__ key.

Here's why you would use CapsLock:

1. The key is very rarely used;
2. Accidental presses can be annoying;
3. Despite all this, the location of the key under the left hand's little finger makes it very convenient;

Setting up Karabiner-Elements is also very simple:

1. First, install Karabiner-Elements and grant all necessary permissions;
2. Then, under the "Complex Modifications" tab, select "Add predefined rule";
3. In the window that opens, choose "Change caps_lock to command+control+option+shift" and click "Enable";

## PuntoSwitcher

PuntoSwitcher is the leader among the utilities I use daily. It solves the problem of typing in the wrong layout. Even if you are touch typing, PuntoSwitcher lets you effortlessly switch layouts without losing work tempo.

This tool allows you to instantly convert a text like "__ghbdtn rfr ltkf?__" into "__hello, how are you?__" using hotkeys.

I use the combination of CapsLock+Space to switch the layout.

Setting up PuntoSwitcher is straightforward. Simply enable or disable auto-switching and assign hotkeys. You can also disable extra features if you don't need them.

In new versions, the developers add various additional features, such as auto-replace or search in Yandex. While these features are not useful to me, they might be to others. It's good that they can easily be switched off.

## Raycast

A great replacement for the standard Spotlight, consider it a Spotlight on steroids. It has several killer features, without which, you will find yourself an incomplete Mac owner.

1. It's free. Unlike [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), where all the most interesting features are paid;
2. Rich community, due to which, a huge number of ready-made [extensions](https://www.raycast.com/store) and [scripts](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands) appear;
3. Built-in [Clipboard History](https://www.raycast.com/extensions/clipboard-history), [Window Management](https://manual.raycast.com/window-management), [Calculator ðŸ¤“](https://manual.raycast.com/calculator) and much [more](https://manual.raycast.com/);

Setting up __Raycast__ is also straightforward:

1. Download, install, grant all necessary permissions;
2. Disable the standard Spotlight call in system settings;

3. Assign a hotkey for Raycast in settings, same as the one where the Spotlight was;
